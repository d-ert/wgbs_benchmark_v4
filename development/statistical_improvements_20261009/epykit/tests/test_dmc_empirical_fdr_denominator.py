"""empirical_fdr_for_dmc must use per-permutation tail counts, not
pooled-null counts (same shape as the DMR fix in test_dmr_empirical_fdr.py).

Strategy: mock process_chromosomes_dmc (the real heavy call inside
_run_one_perm) to return a lightweight stub DMCStore yielding prebuilt
null p-value arrays. This avoids touching the real Parquet store and
lets us control null distributions precisely.
