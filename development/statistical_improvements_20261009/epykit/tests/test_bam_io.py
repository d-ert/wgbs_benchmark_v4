"""BAM ingestion tests (0.5.0).

These tests construct a tiny synthetic BAM with planted methylation
calls (Bismark XM tags) and verify that
:func:`epykit.bam_io.read_methylation_calls` recovers exactly the
calls we planted. Pysam is optional; tests cleanly skip when it isn't
installed.

We deliberately avoid mocking pysam -- building a real (tiny) BAM
exercises the same code path as real Bismark output and catches any
bugs in tag parsing / aligned-pair iteration.
