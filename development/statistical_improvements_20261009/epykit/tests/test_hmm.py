"""Tests for the shared HMM segmentation engine in ``epykit._hmm``.

The contract:
  1. On a hand-built two-state Markov chain with clear emissions, the
     Viterbi path recovers the underlying states with >= 95 % accuracy.
  2. The posteriors sum to 1 per site (correctness check on
     forward-backward normalisation).
  3. ``runs_of_state`` finds the obvious contiguous runs.
  4. Edge cases: empty input, NaN observations, mis-shaped priors.
