"""Layer 3: statistical accuracy on the synthetic fixture.

These tests measure power (sensitivity), empirical FDR (specificity), and
effect-size bias for every DMC backend and both DMR engines against a
ground truth where we *know* which CpGs and which regions are differential.

Why thresholds rather than tight equality? The synthetic data has finite
sample size (8 samples x 5 chr x 2 000 CpGs) and stochastic noise. We pick
thresholds that:

  - any minimally-working implementation would clear easily, AND
  - any of the suspected bugs from the prior audit (dispersion df off by
    one, logit-t variance unbounded near beta=0/1, NaN-after-BH sort) would
    almost certainly fail.

Each test exercises one backend so a regression points at the right place.
