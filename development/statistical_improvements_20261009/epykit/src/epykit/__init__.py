"""epykit: Parquet methylation pipeline (Bismark ingestion -> DMR annotation)

This package provides a complete WGBS analysis pipeline:

  - convert:   Bismark .cov -> partitioned Parquet methylstore
  - filter:    QC / coverage filtering / site intersection
  - dmc:       Differential methylation calling per CpG. Default test is
               ``lr`` (quasi-binomial likelihood-ratio with McCullagh-
               Nelder dispersion). Other backends: welch_t, fisher, glm.
  - dmr:       DMR calling (chain-merge default, with tile, sliding-window
               and HMM-segmentation alternatives) and Gaussian-kernel
               methylation smoothing
  - annotate:  Gene-feature and CpG-island context annotation
  - qc:        Bisulfite conversion rate, global methylation, coverage
               uniformity, plus opt-in clinical / cohort checks

DMC engine choice
-----------------
Bare ``lr`` is the recommended default and the engine the benchmark paper
characterises. ``welch_t``, ``fisher`` and ``glm`` are alternative
engines for specific situations (small samples, single replicates,
covariate-adjusted designs). The ``power_stack="lr+"`` tunable is an
*exploratory* research knob: it bundles four extensions (neighbour
combine, two-stage BH, separation fallback, EB dispersion shrinkage)
that were tuned on the Piao 2021 simulator and have **not** been shown
to improve on bare ``lr`` for real-world WGBS at realistic
overdispersion (real WGBS phi ~ 1.5-5; simulator phi ~ 0.4). On
GSE263850 ``lr+`` inflates DMC counts ~13x at the same q-threshold,
consistent with FPR drift. Use ``lr+`` only if you understand its
heuristics and are willing to validate them on your own data. See
``docs/architecture.md`` for the engine map.

Logging convention
------------------
Library modules (everything under ``epykit.*`` except ``epykit.cli``) emit
progress and diagnostics through the standard :mod:`logging` module via
``logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`` -- they never call :func:`print`.
The CLI entry point (``epykit.cli``) reserves :func:`print` for the
final user-facing result lines on stdout; structured progress logs flow
through the same logging hierarchy and are controlled via ``-v`` / ``-q``.
This split lets host applications and notebooks consume epykit without
having their stdout polluted, while CLI users see the expected output.
