"""The DMC engine registry: which engines exist and the facts about them.

One frozen :class:`EngineSpec` per engine, holding only the facts other
modules consume: whether the engine is a public ``test=`` choice, whether
the ``lr+`` power stack resolves onto it, and which effect-size column it
emits. The numerical code stays in ``dmc.py``; the sample-size warnings,
the ``"auto"`` selection rule and the design checks stay with the code
that runs them.

This module imports only the standard library, so ``_dmc_config``, the
stages, ``tl`` and ``cli`` can import it without pulling in ``dmc.py``.
