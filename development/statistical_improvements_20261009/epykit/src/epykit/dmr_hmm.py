"""DEPRECATED — renamed to ``epykit.dmr_segment`` in 0.7.5.

This shim re-exports the renamed function and emits a
``DeprecationWarning`` on import. Retained in 1.2; scheduled for removal
in a future major release.

Rationale: the engine uses fixed state means and transition
probabilities (not Baum-Welch fitted), so calling it an HMM
was misleading.
