"""Real-engine closures for run_null_calibration.py.

Each registry entry is a factory: ``factory(md) -> closure``, where
the closure has signature:
    closure(samples_treatment, samples_control, seed)
        -> (pvalues: np.ndarray, qvalues: np.ndarray)

Returning both p- and q-values lets the calibration runner build a
Q-Q plot vs Uniform(0, 1) and a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test in addition
to the per-shuffle observed-FDR proportion. The legacy single-array
contract (qvalues only) was sufficient for the FDR summary but
could not distinguish calibrated-but-noisy from conservative tests.

Factories capture the MethylData object once outside the shuffle loop
so the parquet store is loaded only once per (engine, scenario).

Usage in run_null_calibration.py main():
    from _null_engines import ENGINE_REGISTRY
    factory = ENGINE_REGISTRY["lr"]
    closure = factory(md)
    pvals, qvals = closure(samples_treatment=treat, samples_control=ctrl, seed=42)
