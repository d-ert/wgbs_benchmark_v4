    two clearly different label assignments, the returned q-value arrays
    must differ. Before the fix, _permute_md only touched obs.group while
    md.treatment_ids reads obs.treatment, so every shuffle silently ran
    on the original assignment and returned the same q-values.

    A full label swap (treatment <-> control) is two-sidedly symmetric
    for the LR test and yields bit-identical q-values even after the
    fix, so we use an ASYMMETRIC mixed permutation instead: move one
    sample across the group boundary, leave the rest alone. The
    resulting test compares 3-vs-5 to the original 4-vs-4.

    Historically ``ep.tl.dmc`` had a weak-hit cache branch in
    ``src/epykit/dmc.py`` that short-circuited recomputation whenever
    the per-chrom parquets were already on disk -- even when the
    cached manifest's ``input_sig`` differed from the current call.
    That has been fixed: a differing ``input_sig`` now invalidates the
    cache and triggers a recompute. We rely on that here -- no manual
    cache wipe between the two closure calls. The bug originally
    guarded against (permutation only touching obs.group, not
    obs.treatment) is independent of the cache, but the cache fix is
    what makes this regression observable without an rmtree workaround.
